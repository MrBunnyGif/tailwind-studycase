/* 
  These three lines of code import the base, component, and utility styles from Tailwind CSS.
  The base styles are the default styles for HTML elements, the component styles are for more complex UI components,
  and the utility styles provide low-level utility classes for styling individual elements.
  By importing these styles, we can use them in our application without having to write custom CSS.
